# Integration of QR Code Reading and AR Scene

The integration of QR code reading to open an AR scene involves a combination of Unity's AR Foundation and a QR code scanning library or API.

## Steps:

1. **Set Up AR Foundation:**
   - Ensure that you have AR Foundation and the AR Subsystems installed in your Unity project using the Unity Package Manager.

2. **Integrate QR Code Scanning:**
   - Choose a QR code scanning library or API for Unity (e.g., ZXing). Import it into your project and attach a script to an object in your scene.

3. **Handle QR Code Scanning:**
   - Write code to handle the result of the QR code scanning process. Extract relevant information from the QR code data.

4. **Load AR Scene:**
   - Create an AR scene or content based on the QR code data. Load the appropriate AR scene or activate the corresponding AR content using AR Foundation's functionalities.

## Example Script (using AR Foundation and ZXing):

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems;
using ZXing;

public class QRCodeScanner : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IBarcodeReader barcodeReader;
    private ARSessionOrigin arSessionOrigin;

    private void Start()
    {
        barcodeReader = new BarcodeReader();
        arSessionOrigin = FindObjectOfType<ARSessionOrigin>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        // Example: Trigger scanning when a button is pressed.
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            ScanQRCode();
        }
    }

    private void ScanQRCode()
    {
        // Capture the camera image
        Texture2D cameraTexture = ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture();

        // Decode the QR code
        Result result = barcodeReader.Decode(cameraTexture.GetPixels32(), cameraTexture.width, cameraTexture.height);
        
        if (result != null)
        {
            // Process the result (e.g., load AR scene based on the QR code data)
            Debug.Log("QR Code Scanned: " + result.Text);
            LoadARScene(result.Text);
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log("No QR Code found");
        }
    }

    private void LoadARScene(string sceneIdentifier)
    {
        // Implement logic to load the AR scene based on the QR code data
        // For example, use the sceneIdentifier to determine which AR scene to load
        // arSessionOrigin.LoadScene(sceneIdentifier);
    }
}
```
