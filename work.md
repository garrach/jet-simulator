# Game Development Project Overview

## Unity, Blender

### UI Game/Settings/Main Menu
Create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces for game settings and the main menu. Implement smooth animations for UI elements to enhance user experience. Manage settings such as graphics, sound, and controls within the UI.

### Animation
Develop dynamic and engaging animations for characters, objects, and environmental elements. Utilize Unity's animation system to bring life to the game world, ensuring fluid movements and realistic interactions.

### Modeling
Design detailed 3D models for characters, environments, and objects in Blender. Pay attention to textures, proportions, and overall aesthetics to create a visually cohesive and immersive game environment.

### Shading
Apply shading techniques to 3D models to enhance their visual appeal. Experiment with lighting effects, shadows, and reflections to achieve realistic and captivating visuals within the game scenes.

### Rendering Scene
Optimize rendering settings for game scenes to achieve a balance between graphical fidelity and performance. Consider factors such as lighting, shadows, and anti-aliasing to create visually stunning and responsive gameplay.

## Visual Studio (C#)

### Light Feedback
Implement dynamic lighting effects to enhance the atmosphere and mood of the game. Use light feedback to draw attention to important elements, create realistic shadows, and contribute to the overall aesthetics.

### Game Actions
Code and manage a variety of in-game actions and mechanics. This includes player movement, interactions with objects, combat systems, and any other gameplay features. Ensure responsiveness and smooth transitions between different actions.

### Logic Gates for Wiring System
Develop a logical wiring system within the game to simulate realistic interactions between different components. Use logic gates to create complex and interactive puzzles or systems that respond to player actions.

### AR Foundation with QR Scanner
Integrate AR features using AR Foundation, allowing players to experience augmented reality within the game. Implement a QR scanner to enable users to interact with real-world objects or trigger AR content using QR codes.

### Switch Between Modes
Implement functionality to seamlessly switch between different game modes, such as exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. Ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the overall gaming experience.

## Resources

### Database of Wiring Structures
Create a comprehensive database to store information on wiring structures related to different vehicle systems in the game. Include details such as connection points, electrical specifications, and troubleshooting information.

### Design Pattern of Vehicle Parts
Develop a design pattern for vehicle parts to ensure consistency and modularity. This helps in the efficient creation and management of various vehicle components, promoting a systematic approach to design.

## Visual Studio Code (Node.js)

### WebApi Interface
Develop a robust WebAPI interface using Node.js to facilitate communication between the game and external services. Enable features such as user authentication, data synchronization, and real-time updates.

### Models Structure
Define a clear and organized structure for models used in the Node.js backend. This includes user profiles, game statistics, and any other relevant data. Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

### Analytics
Implement analytics functionality to track and analyze user behavior. Collect data on player preferences, in-game actions, and progression to make informed decisions for future updates and improvements.

### Rating
Include a rating system for user feedback and evaluation. Allow players to provide ratings for different aspects of the game, such as gameplay, graphics, and overall enjoyment.

### Adv/Dis-Adv
Implement features for users to list advantages and disadvantages they encounter during gameplay. This valuable feedback can be used for continuous improvement and addressing player concerns.

### Scenarios/Scene
Manage different scenarios or scenes within the game through the Node.js backend. This includes defining quest progression, storylines, and dynamic events that enhance the overall narrative and player engagement.

# Integration of QR Code Reading and AR Scene

The integration of QR code reading to open an AR scene involves a combination of Unity's AR Foundation and a QR code scanning library or API.

## Steps:

1. **Set Up AR Foundation:**
   - Ensure that you have AR Foundation and the AR Subsystems installed in your Unity project using the Unity Package Manager.

2. **Integrate QR Code Scanning:**
   - Choose a QR code scanning library or API for Unity (e.g., ZXing). Import it into your project and attach a script to an object in your scene.

3. **Handle QR Code Scanning:**
   - Write code to handle the result of the QR code scanning process. Extract relevant information from the QR code data.

4. **Load AR Scene:**
   - Create an AR scene or content based on the QR code data. Load the appropriate AR scene or activate the corresponding AR content using AR Foundation's functionalities.

## Example Script (using AR Foundation and ZXing):

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems;
using ZXing;

public class QRCodeScanner : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IBarcodeReader barcodeReader;
    private ARSessionOrigin arSessionOrigin;

    private void Start()
    {
        barcodeReader = new BarcodeReader();
        arSessionOrigin = FindObjectOfType<ARSessionOrigin>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        // Example: Trigger scanning when a button is pressed.
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            ScanQRCode();
        }
    }

    private void ScanQRCode()
    {
        // Capture the camera image
        Texture2D cameraTexture = ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture();

        // Decode the QR code
        Result result = barcodeReader.Decode(cameraTexture.GetPixels32(), cameraTexture.width, cameraTexture.height);
        
        if (result != null)
        {
            // Process the result (e.g., load AR scene based on the QR code data)
            Debug.Log("QR Code Scanned: " + result.Text);
            LoadARScene(result.Text);
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log("No QR Code found");
        }
    }

    private void LoadARScene(string sceneIdentifier)
    {
        // Implement logic to load the AR scene based on the QR code data
        // For example, use the sceneIdentifier to determine which AR scene to load
        // arSessionOrigin.LoadScene(sceneIdentifier);
    }
}
```
