### Adv/Dis-Adv
- Implement features for users to list advantages and disadvantages.

### Scenarios/Scene
- Manage different scenarios or scenes within the game through the Node.js backend.

## QR Code Reading and AR Scene Opening

1. **Set Up AR Foundation:**
   - Ensure that you have AR Foundation and the AR Subsystems installed in your Unity project.

2. **Integrate QR Code Scanning:**
   - Choose a QR code scanning library or API for Unity (e.g., ZXing) and import it into your project.

3. **Handle QR Code Scanning:**
   - Write code to handle the result of the QR code scanning process. Extract relevant information from the QR code data.

4. **Load AR Scene:**
   - Create an AR scene or content that corresponds to the QR code data.
   - When a valid QR code is scanned, load the appropriate AR scene or activate the corresponding AR content.

## Tracking User Behavior and Sending to WebAPI

### Tracking User Behavior in Unity:

1. **Identify Events to Track:**
   - Determine which user interactions and events you want to track.

2. **Create a Tracking Manager:**
   - Implement a manager or singleton in Unity to handle tracking.
```csharp
public class TrackingManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static TrackingManager instance;

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (instance == null)
        {
            instance = this;
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        }
        else
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }

    public void LogEvent(string eventName)
    {
        // Send the event data to the analytics system
        SendToAnalytics(eventName);
    }

    private void SendToAnalytics(string eventName)
    {
        // Implement the logic to send data to your analytics system
        // This could involve creating a JSON payload and making a web request
    }
}
```
3. **Log Events in Your Code:**
   - Call the log event method in your code wherever you want to track an event.
```csharp
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Coin"))
        {
            // Player collected a coin
            TrackingManager.instance.LogEvent("CoinCollected");
        }
    }
}

```
### Sending Data to WebAPI:

1. **Create a WebAPI:**
   - Develop a WebAPI using Node.js that will receive the analytics data.

2. **Define API Endpoints:**
   - Define API endpoints for receiving analytics data.
```csharp
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/logEvent', (req, res) => {
    const eventData = req.body;
    // Process the eventData (e.g., save to a database)
    console.log('Received event data:', eventData);
    res.status(200).send('Event data received successfully');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});

```
3. **Send Data from Unity to WebAPI:**
   - Modify the `SendToAnalytics` method in the Unity tracking manager to send data to your WebAPI.
```csharp
private void SendToAnalytics(string eventName)
{
    // Create a JSON payload
    var eventData = new { EventName = eventName, Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow };

    // Convert to JSON string
    string jsonData = JsonUtility.ToJson(eventData);

    // Send the data to the WebAPI
    StartCoroutine(PostDataToAPI(jsonData));
}

private IEnumerator PostDataToAPI(string jsonData)
{
    string url = "http://yourwebapi.com/logEvent";

    // Create a UnityWebRequest to post the data
    using (UnityWebRequest request = new UnityWebRequest(url, "POST"))
    {
        byte[] bodyRaw = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jsonData);
        request.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(bodyRaw);
        request.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();
        request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

        // Send the request
        yield return request.SendWebRequest();

        if (request.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
        {
            Debug.Log("Event data sent successfully");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogError("Failed to send event data: " + request.error);
        }
    }
}
```
